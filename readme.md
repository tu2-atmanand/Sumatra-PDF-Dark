## SumatraPDF Reader Dark

SumatraPDF is a multi-format (PDF, EPUB, MOBI, CBZ, CBR, FB2, CHM, XPS, DjVu) reader for Windows under (A)GPLv3 license, with some code under BSD license (see AUTHORS). This is the best PDF Reader i found ever, because i always search for the most lightweight softwares, and this software is at the next level, in terms of resource optimization and also one more features i was searching all the time which the giant PDF Readers and Editors couldnt able to provide or it doesnt looks good is changing the theme of the document(Images included).
The original Project can be found here : [SumatraPDF Reader](https://www.sumatrapdfreader.org/free-pdf-reader)

This fork is to make few changes in the original software and add some more features. And also to help people to understand the structure and explain how to tweak this code.

## TODO:

1. Make Dark theme for the complete window including the Welcome page, Toolbar, etc.
2. More buttons in toolbar for changing the theme of the document view.
3. Add more keyboard Features.
4. Transparent and autohide scrollbar.
